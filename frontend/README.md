Overall
* The majority of functionality is present in the webpage however, minor discrepancies play a part in altering the way the tests are handled. E.g. 3c has and is working however due to problems regarding cypress, the console is not passing the test
* Utilises the MVC framework to operate.

Levels 1 and 2

* Both levels 1 and 2 pass with the updated Strapi backend. Level 2 however, company data was never properly implemented.
* Furthermore, all the correct comments were placed where necessary
* The module name, student number, student name and current file opened are all present on files that had been modified from the origin.


Levels 3 and 4
* Functionality is present for both login and search.
* They both work as intended besides the user view.
* The css was created in order to present this data in a succint, clean and orderly fashion.
* Simplicity was the key when creating the css and I hope the markers can appreciate a clean aesthetic I was going for
